I am gonna do a hoomework expand like python library. So I will work with other guys in my class.



So we implement our movie text file in a graph. We will read those points on the map and the length of each two points.
My work is cpp file. And rest of our project is done by my team members. 
So in my cpp file It will read the file,find out the length oh the graph, then find a movie or rent a movie and show it title, then we are going to add new graph, search for graph, after that print the points and graph.
